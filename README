It allows you to delete a buffer without closing the window. It meets the following criteria:

    * The window layout must be kept in all circumstances.
    * If there is an alternate buffer, the window must show that instead.
    * If there is no alternate buffer then the window must show the previous buffer.
    * If there is no alternate nor previous buffer (it is the only buffer) it must show an empty buffer. 

If there are two windows with the same buffer open, both windows will remain open, and the buffer will be deleted

To delete a buffer while keeping the window open, just type **<leader>bd**

Thanks to the authors of kwbd.vim and minibufexpl.vim!
